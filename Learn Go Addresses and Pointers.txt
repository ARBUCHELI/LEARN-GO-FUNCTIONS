# LEARN GO: ADDRESSES AND POINTERS
----------------------------------

* The Point of Pointers and Addresses
-------------------------------------
Go is a pass-by-value language. In other words, we’re passing functions the value of an argument. In a technical sense, when we’re calling a function with an argument, the Go compiler is 
strictly using the value of the argument rather than the argument itself. Because of this feature (pass-by-value), the changes that take place in our function, stay within that function.

Picture a teacher with a classroom of students and the teacher needs the students to complete a worksheet. The teacher will have the original copy of the worksheet and make copies for 
his/her students to write on, but the students are not directly writing on the teacher’s copy.

But, we do have the ability to change values from different scopes. To do so, we need to make use of:

	. addresses
	. pointers
	. dereferencing

Now that we know what topics we need to reference, let’s quickly address this situation and get to the point!

* Instructions
--------------
Read through the code provided and think about what is supposed to be printed out. Does the value of x change? In the next couple of exercises, we’ll explore the why.

main.go
-------
package main

import "fmt"

func addHundred(num int) {
  num += 100
}

func main() {
  x := 1
  
  addHundred(x)
  
  fmt.Println(x) 
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Addresses
-----------
Picture being in class and taking part in a lesson. When we hear an important detail, we write it down in our notebook for reference later. This same idea of storing important information 
somewhere is the reason why we declare variables in Go. But instead of writing information down in a notebook, a computer sets aside some space in its memory to store the value. The space 
that the computer allocates is called an address. Each address is marked as a unique numerical value.

Every time we use a variable, what we’re doing is retrieving the value stored at the variable’s address. Here’s a simple visualization:

Go diagram showing memory addresses with corresponding hexadecimal values for the addresses

To find a variable’s address we use the & operator followed by the variable name, like so:

x := "My very first address"
fmt.Println(&x) // Prints 0x414020

When we see the 0x prefix, this means that the number is in formatted in hexadecimal, which is a way of representing 16 digit numbers. Thus, the 0x414020 is actually the address of x in hexadecimal format.

Let’s print out the address of a variable for ourselves.

* Instructions
--------------
Checkpoint 1 Passed
1.
Given the treasure variable, print out the address of the variable.


Hint
To find the address, use the & operator the name of the variable, like so:

x := "Hello!"
fmt.Println(&x)

main.go
-------
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	treasure := "The friends we make along the way."
	
	// Add your code below:
fmt.Println(&treasure)
}
